This repository contains all the games I developed during my personal challenge to create Different games using Unity. Each game was made from scratch with the goal of exploring new ideas, having fun, and improving my skills as a game developer.

Each game has:

Screenshots: Showcasing gameplay and visuals.

Scripts: The C# scripts that bring the game to life

The main objectives of this challenge were:

To experiment with different gameplay mechanics and genres.

To practice rapid prototyping and iteration.


Technologies Used
  
  Unity: The primary engine for developing all games.
  
  C#: For scripting game logic.
  
  Canva : For creating Canvas In Unity 
  
ðŸ’¡ Inspiration
